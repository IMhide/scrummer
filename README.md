# Scrummer

I'm working with Trello. A lot. I've used the [Scrum for Trello plugin](https://github.com/Q42/TrelloScrum), but I found
it slowing down Trello when working with a lot of cards. So I wrote a new plugin
from scratch, without dependencies on external libraries to keep the footprint as
small as possible. Using native browser API's instead of jQuery makes it lightning-fast!

Big kudo's to the guys at Q42 for building Scrum for Trello. If you want more features,
use theirs. Use this plugin if you just want to keep track of storypoints and totals
for each column in your board, nothing else.

## Features

* Displays the number of points for each card in a badge (this in 0.1).
* Clickable buttons next to the title-field to quickly enter your estimate (this will be in 0.2).
